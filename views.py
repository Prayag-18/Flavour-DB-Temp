Pure acetic acid is produced commercially by a number of different processes. As dilute solutions, it is obtained from alcohol by the “Quick-Vinegar Process ” Smaller quantities are obtained from the pyroligneous acid liquors acquired in the destructive distilla-tion of hard wood. It is manufactured synthetically in high yields by the oxidation of acetaldehyde and of butane, and as the reaction product of methanol and carbon monoxide Vinegars are produced from cider, grapes (or wine), sucrose, glucose or malt by successive alcoholic and acetous fermentations. In the United States, the use of the term “vinegar,” without qualifying adjectives, implies only cider vinegar. Although a 4 to 8% solution of pure acetic acid would have the same taste characteristics as cider vinegar, it could not qualify as a vinegar, since it would lack other readily detectable components characteristic of cider vinegar.

It is commercially available in bundles consisting of thin, mem-branous agglutinated strips or in cut, flaked granulated or powdered form. Although agar was discovered in Japan in 1658, it was introduced to Europe and the United States from China in the nineteenth century, where it was initially used as a gelatin substitute in the making of desserts. It soon became widely used as a solid bacteriological culture medium after its use by Robert Koch in his famous experiments. Its major uses in the food industry of today are in bakery products, confectionary, dairy products and canned meat and fish. It is also used in microbiology, dentistry and medicine The Gelidium species amansii and cartilageneum are the major sources of agar, although many species of Rhodophyceae are used. The weeds (agarophytes) used in the commercial product of agar grow from the tide line out to depths of 120 ft, and are harvested by waders along the shore at low tide, raked from small boats or picked by divers. Japan is the largest producer of agar. Because agar is soluble in hot water but relatively insoluble in cold water, it is extracted by boiling the agarophyte in water, filtering, cooling to form a gel, cutting into pieces and frozen, then thawing to free the agar from salts and other impuri-ties that are soluble in cold water. The wet agar is repeatedly washed with cold water and finally dried. American and Japanese agar are graded according to published specifications. The high-quality American agar is divided into bacteriological, medici-nal and dental grades, and the Japanese agar, into three grades and two subgrades. It is odorless or with a slight characteristic odor and mucilaginous taste. The structure of agar is not completely known.

As a flavor ingredient/enhancer, as, for example, in orange juice, acetaldehyde helps create naturalness, fruitiness and juiciness ","Acetic acid, CH3COOH, is a colorless, volatile liquid at ambient temperatures. The pure compound, glacial acetic acid, owes its name to its ice-like crystalline appearance at 15.6°C. As generally supplied, acetic acid is a 6 N aqueous solution (about 36%) or a 1 N solution (about 6%). These or other dilutions are used in adding appropriate amounts of acetic acid to foods. Acetic acid is the characteristic acid of vinegar, its concentration ranging from 3.5 to 5.6%. Acetic acid and acetates are present in most plants and animal tissues in small but detectable amounts. They are normal metabolic intermediates, are produced by such bacterial species as Acetobacter and can be synthesized completely from carbon dioxide by such microorganisms as Clostridium thermoaceticum. The rat forms acetate at the rate of 1% of its body weight per day As a colorless liquid with a strong, pungent, characteristic vinegar odor, it is useful in butter, cheese, grape and fruit flavors. Very little pure acetic acid as such is used in foods, although it is classified by FDA as a GRAS material. Consequently, it may be employed in products that are not covered by Definitions and Standards of Identity. Acetic acid is the principal component of vinegars and pyroligneous acid. In the form of vinegar, more than 27 million lb were added to food in 1986, with approximately equal amounts used as acidulants and flavoring agents. In fact, acetic acid (as vinegar) was one of the earliest flavoring agents. Vinegars are used extensively in preparing salad dressing and mayonnaise, sour and sweet pickles and numerous sauces and cat-sups. They are also used in the curing of meat and in the canning of certain vegetables. In the manufacture of mayonnaise, the addition of a portion of acetic acid (vinegar) to the salt- or sugar-yolk reduces the heat resistance of Salmonella. Water binding compositions of sausages often include acetic acid or its sodium salt, while calcium acetate is used to preserve the texture of sliced, canned vegetables ","Acetoin is a yellowish liquid with a bland, woody, yogurt odor and a fatty creamy “tub” butter taste. It is useful as a flavor ingredient in butter, milk, yogurt or strawberry flavors ","Acetophenone has a characteristic sweet, pungent and strong medicinal odor with a bitter, aromatic cherry branch taste. It is useful in flavors of grape, cherry and tobacco ","Acetylpyrazine has a nutty, popcorn, bread crust odor ","Aconitic acid has pleasant, winey, acid taste; almost odorless. Aconitic acid of the trans-configuration can be isolated during the processing of sugarcane by precipitating it as the calcium salt from cane syrup or molasses. The concentration in molasses ranges from 1.8 to 2.5%. Aconitic acid may be synthesized from citric acid by dehydration with sulfuric acid or by catalytic dehy-dration. The cis-configuration is somewhat unstable and is readily rearranged to the trans form by heating. Trans-aconitic acid is decarboxylated to itaconic acid by heating to 180°F. The cis form occurs in plant and animal tissues as a metabolic intermediate in the Krebs cycle during the isomerization of citric acid to isocitric acid by the action of enzyme aconitase ","Adipic acid is a crystalline powder with practically no odor. It has the lowest acidity of any of the acids commonly used in foods and has excellent buffering capacity in the range of pH 2.5 to 3.0. Like succinic and fumaric acid, adipic acid is practically nonhygroscopic. Its addition to foods imparts a smooth, tart taste. In grape-flavored products, it adds a lingering supplementary flavor and gives an excellent set to food powders containing gelatin. As a result, adipic acid has found a wide number of uses as an accidu-lant in dry powdered food mixtures, especially in those products having delicate flavors and where addition of tang to the flavor is undesirable Its aqueous solutions have the lowest acidity of any of the common food acids. For concentrations from 0.5 to 2.4 g/100 mL, the pH of its solution varies less than half a unit. Hence, it can be used as a buffering agent to maintain acidities within the range of 2.5 to 3.0. This is highly desirable in certain foods, yet the pH is low enough to inhibit the browning of most fruits and other foodstuffs ","Agglomerated fine white powder; cool refreshing aroma","Allyl 10-undecenoate has a fruital aroma suggestive of pineapple","Allyl anthranilate is used as a flavor enhancer and flavoring agent","Allyl butyrate has a peach/apricot odor and is used as a flavoring ingredient and adjuvant","Allyl cyclohexanehexanoate has a weak fatty, fruity odor and is used as a flavoring agent or adjuvant ","Allyl cyclohexanevalerate has a characteristic fruital (peach, apricot, apple) aroma and is used as a flavoring agent or adjuvant ","Allyl disulfide has a characteristic garlic odor.

The nonessential amino acid, arginine, is a urea cycle amino acid and a precursor for the neurotransmitter nitric oxide, which plays a role in the regulation of the brain’s system of dilation and constriction of small blood vessels. It is strongly alkaline and its water solutions absorb carbon dioxide from the air (FCC, 1996). Functionality in foods includes, but is not limited to, nutrient and dietary supplement ","Ascorbic acid is present in nutritionally useful amounts in many edible plants, especially in rapidly growing leafy vegetables, fruits, tomatoes and potatoes. Foods of animal origin as usually consumed are generally poor sources of the vitamin. Of the stereoisomers (L-ascorbic acid, D-ascorbic acid, L-isoascorbic acid and D-isoascorbic acid or erythorbic acid), only L-ascorbic acid has significant vitamin C activity. The vitamin C activity of ascorbyl palmitate is approximately equal to that of L-ascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid has a pleasant, sharp, acidic taste without any odor. It is extensively used as antioxidant, meat-curing aid, nutrient and dietary supplement. For a detailed description, see Burdock (1997) ","Benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal has a sweet, floral note; also reminiscent of almond ","Benzenethiol has a repulsive, penetrating, garlic-like odor ","Benzoic acid is almost odorless or exhibits a faint urine, almond odor and a sweet–sour to acrid taste. Sodium benzoate as an article of commerce is in the form of a white powder or flakes. It can be mixed dry into bulk liquids and dissolves promptly. The pH range for optimum microbial inhibition by benzoic acid is 2.5 to 4.0, which is lower than that of sorbic acid or propionic acid. Thus, benzoates are well adapted for the preservation of food, which are acid, or readily acidified, such as carbonated beverages, fruit juices, cider, pickles and sauerkraut ","Benzoic acid is almost odorless or exhibits a sweet, faint, balsamic odor and a sweet–sour to acrid taste.

BHT has a very faint, musty, occasional cresylic-type odor. BHA and BHT are extensively used in foods as antioxidants. Most fats, oils and fat-containing foods are naturally susceptible to rapid rancification and other oxidative reactions that produce compounds having objectionable taste and odor, making foods containing them unpalatable. Lipid oxidation is autocatalytic and proceeds as a complex of chain reactions, the nature and speed of which vary with the substrate, temperature, light, availability of oxygen and presence or absence of oxidation catalysts. Antioxidants like BHT act as “chain breaks” in the autooxidation processes under the usual conditions of processing, storage and use of fat-containing foods (Burdock, 1997) ","BHA and BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene) are monohydric phenolic antioxidants that, prior to their introduction and accep-tance in the food industry, were used to protect petroleum against oxidative degumming. Chemically, BHA is a mixture of two isomers, 3-tertiary-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole (90%) and 2-tertiary-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole (10%). Both BHA and BHT assert a good carry-through effect, although BHA is slightly better than BHT in this respect. BHT is, however, more effective in suppressing oxidation of animal fats than vegetable oils. Among its multiple applications, BHA is particularly useful in protecting the flavors and color of essential oils and is considered the most effective of all food-approved antioxidants for this application. BHA is particularly effective in controlling the oxidation of short-chain fatty acids, such as those found in coconut and palm kernel oils that are used typically in cereal and confectionary products ","Biphenyl has a pungent odor, reminiscent of rose on dilution ","bis-(2-Methyl-3-furyl) tetrasulfide has a meaty aroma","bis-(2-Methyl-3-furyl)disulfide has an overall roasty, meat-like, sulfur-like odor.

It is one of the xanthine derivatives present up to 1.5% in seeds of coffee (Coffea arabica L ) and up to 5% in the leaves of tea (Camelia sinensis). It is a component of the beverages made from these plants. Caffeine is also a component of chocolate (Theobroma cacao) and the cola nut (Cola acuminata Schott and Endel. and related species), the extract of which is used in cola drinks. It is virtually odorless. Caffeine is added to cola-type beverages for its enhance-ment of flavor. Subtle and subliminal flavors are widely appreciated by consumers and caffeine has a modifying effect on other com-ponents of the beverage. The threshold for detecting the presence of caffeine in liquid foods varies depending on the nature of other substances present, but lies close to the level characteristic of currently produced cola-type beverages. The threshold for detection of caffeine in water has been shown to be 0.0095%; in liquid foods, 0.0184%. In one study, panelists could distinguish a solution con-taining 0.0058% caffeine from the control. The threshold for detecting taste difference between an aqueous solution of caffeine and a water control was also shown to be 0.005% caffeine and to distinguish bitterness, 0.011% caffeine. In aqueous solutions containing threshold and subthreshold concentrations of caffeine, sucrose, citric acid and salt, all compounds depressed the taste intensity of each other *","Calcium acetate, also known as acetate of lime or vinegar salts, is the calcium salt of acetic acid. It is an odorless pow-der. Calcium has an important role in the nutrition of humans and animals. Hormonal mechanisms control absorption of dietary cal-cium (including added calcium salts) allowing adaptation to a range of calcium intakes while maintaining a relatively constant blood calcium concentration of about 10 mg/100 mL. Major functions of calcium inside the body include the formation and maintenance of bones and teeth, the physiology of muscle contraction, the cell membrane integrity, the activity of several enzymes that have specific requirement for it, the coagulation of blood, and the regulation of acid-base balance *","Camphene has a terpene, camphoraceous taste ","caramel, savory.

It has a faint, mild odor and a bland characteristic taste ","Cellulose is a natural substance normally present in most diets because it is the major structural carbohydrate of green plants. Cellulose is essentially a linear polymer of glucopyranose units connected by α-1,4-glucoside links. In nature, cellulose is present in plant cell walls as fibers. The molecular weight of the isolated cellulose is approximately 50,000 daltons. The principal sources of cellulose for food-related purposes are cotton linters and wood pulp Chemical processing converts cellulose into forms or derivatives suitable for incorporation into food products or for use in food packaging materials. For food use, the optimum degree of substitution of a carboxymethyl-residue on each anhydroglucopyranose unit on cellulose is 0.95. By preliminary mild acid hydrolysis, the degree of polymerization (i e , molecular size) of the cellulose may be reduced before carboxymethylation. Control of the degree of substitution and the degree of polymerization during process-ing results in production of a wide variety of derivatives that differ in such physical properties as gelling, temperature, viscosity and dispersibility in water. Sodium carboxymethyl cellulose is used as a thickening agent and stabilizer in foods.
